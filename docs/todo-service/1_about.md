# About

The Todo service provides robust task management capabilities, enabling users to create, assign, and monitor tasks across various contexts. Tasks can be assigned between users, facilitating efficient delegation and collaboration. Each task is associated with specific details such as title, category (like assignment types), and context identifiers, ensuring clarity on its purpose and relevance.

For instance, a task titled "Reassign" categorized under assignment, indicates that it involves reallocating a user to a new group or project. The task is linked to a specific user context, identified by a unique ID, and comes with defined start and due dates, providing a clear timeline for completion. Its current status, marked as incomplete, shows that it is in progress, while its publish state ensures it remains visible and actively managed.

Moreover, tasks in the todo service can include detailed actionable data, specifying various operations like project transitions, role changes, or reassignment tasks, ensuring a smooth flow throughout the task lifecycle.
